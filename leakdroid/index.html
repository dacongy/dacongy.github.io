<h1>LeakDroid: Systematic Testing for Resource Leaks in Android Applications</h1>

<p>
The use of mobile devices and the complexity of their software continue to
grow rapidly. This growth presents significant challenges for software
correctness and performance. In addition to traditional defects, a key
consideration are defects related to the limited resources available on
these devices. Resource leaks in an application, due to improper management
of resources, can lead to slowdowns, crashes, and negative user experience.
Despite a large body of existing work on leak detection, testing for
resource leaks remains a challenging problem. We propose a novel and
comprehensive approach for systematic testing for resource leaks in Android
software. Similar to existing testing techniques, the approach is based on a
GUI model, but is focused specifically on coverage criteria aimed at
resource leak defects. These criteria are based on neutral cycles: sequences
of GUI events that should have a "neutral" effect and should not lead to
increases in resource usage.

<p>
We have defined several test coverage criteria based on different categories
of neutral cycles in the GUI model. This approach is informed by knowledge
of typical causes of resource leaks in Android software. We have also
developed LeakDroid,
a tool that generates test cases to trigger repeated execution of neutral
cycles. When the test cases are executed, resource usage is monitored for
suspicious behaviors. The approach has been evaluated on several Android
applications. The evaluation demonstrates that the proposed test generation
effectively uncovers a variety of resource leaks. This page contains the
conference paper describing this work, the implementation of LeakDroid, as
well as the applications, models, and test cases used in our experiments.

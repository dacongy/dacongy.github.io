<h1>LeakDroid: Systematic Testing for Resource Leaks in Android Applications</h1>

The use of mobile devices and the complexity of their software continue to grow
rapidly. This growth presents significant challenges for software correctness <br />
and performance.  In addition to traditional defects, a key consideration are
defects related to the limited resources available on these devices. Resource <br />
leaks in an application, due to improper management of resources, can lead to
slowdowns, crashes, and negative user experience. Despite a large body of <br />
existing work on leak detection, testing for resource leaks remains a
challenging problem. We propose a novel and comprehensive approach for <br />
systematic testing for resource leaks in Android software. Similar to existing
testing techniques, the approach is based on a GUI model, but is focused <br />
specifically on coverage criteria aimed at resource leak defects. These
criteria are based on neutral cycles: sequences of GUI events that should have <br />
a “neutral” effect and should not lead to increases in resource usage. Several
important categories of neutral cycles are considered in the proposed test <br />
coverage criteria. Experimental evaluation and case studies were performed on
eight Android applications. The approach exposed 18 resource leak defects, 12 <br />
of which were previously unknown.  These results provide motivation for future
work on analysis, testing, and prevention of resource leaks in Android software.

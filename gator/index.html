The popularity of Android software has grown dramatically in the last few
years. It is essential for researchers in programming languages and compilers
to contribute new techniques in this increasingly important area. Such
techniques require a foundation of program analyses for Android. The target of
our work is to provide a pro<font color="3369E8">g</font>ram
<font color="D50F25">a</font>nalysis <font color="EEB211">t</font>oolkit
f<font color="009925">o</font>r And<font color="666666">r</font>oid (GATOR).
As a first component of this toolkit, we develop a static reference analysis
for GUI objects in Android software.
<!--which models the flow of object references.-->
<!--Existing reference analyses cannot be applied directly to Android-->
<!--because the software is component-based and event-driven.-->

<p>
An Android application is driven by a graphical user interface (GUI),
with GUI objects responding to user actions. These objects and the 
event handlers associated with them ultimately determine the possible
flow of control and data. We propose the first static analysis to
model GUI-related Android objects, their flow through the application,
and their interactions with each other via the abstractions defined by
the Android platform. A formal semantics for the relevant Android
constructs is developed to provide a solid foundation for this and 
other analyses. Next, we propose a constraint-based reference analysis
based on the semantics. The analysis employs a constraint graph to
model the flow of GUI objects, the hierarchical structure of these
objects, and the effects of relevant Android operations. Experimental
evaluation on real-world Android applications strongly suggests that
the analysis achieves high precision with low cost.

<p>
The analysis enables static modeling of control/data flow that is
foundational for compiler analyses, instrumentation for 
event/interaction profiling, static error checking, security analysis,
test generation, and automated debugging. It provides a key component
to be used by compile-time analysis researchers in the growing area of
Android software.
